# Joinville Covid-19 analysis

A python script that parses data from a `csv` file generated by SIM(Sistema de Informação sobre Mortalidade) into a "human readable" `csv`,
to be used on a BI tool like Google Data Studio or Microsoft Power BI, to get some information about Covid-19 deaths on Joinville.

The script was written on jupyter notebook to make it easier to understand, as we can add some markdown between the code snippets.

> As the `csv` from SIM has more than 200MB, it will not be uploaded here, but you can download it on the following link: [SIM data](https://dados.gov.br/dataset/sistema-de-informacao-sobre-mortalidade)
